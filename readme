⚠️ Notes
This runs on Django development server

Not intended for production without WSGI/ASGI

Designed for learning, demos, and portfolios

🧩 Highlights
No eval() - AST-based safe evaluation

No external JS libraries - Pure vanilla JavaScript

One-file Django app - Easy to understand and deploy

Clean separation of UI, API, and evaluator

Excellent portfolio project - Shows modern web dev skills

🔧 Development Features
Secure Expression Evaluation
Uses Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module to parse and evaluate expressions safely, preventing code injection attacks.

Memory Management
Browser-based LocalStorage keeps memory values persistent across sessions.

Error Handling
Graceful error messages without page reloads for better user experience.

Responsive Design
Optimized for all screen sizes from desktop to mobile.

📱 Mobile Features
Touch-optimized buttons

Responsive layout

Adaptive font sizes

Gesture support (coming soon)

🔒 Security Features
AST Parser: No arbitrary code execution

CSRF Protection: Built-in Django security

Input Validation: Whitelisted characters only

Expression Limits: Prevent DoS attacks

🎯 Example Calculations
python
# Basic arithmetic
"5 + 3 * 2" → 11

# Scientific functions
"sin(30) + cos(60)" → 1.0

# Percentage operations
"100 + 20%" → 120

# Constants
"2 * π" → 6.283185307179586
